**Local-only terminal coding assistant. No API keys. No cloud. No subscriptions. No frontier model calls. Ever.**

Foxforge is a local-only AI workspace for research, writing, and software generation.
It routes requests through specialized multi-agent pipelines — each lane a coordinated team of models working in defined stages toward a quality-controlled output. Everything runs on your own hardware, on models you control, with data that never leaves your machine.

There is no external API integration and there never will be. The architecture is deliberately closed to frontier providers.

## Why Foxforge

| | Foxforge | Cloud AI assistants |
|---|---|---|
| **Runs on** | Your own hardware | Provider's servers |
| **AI models** | Any Ollama-compatible or llama.cpp model | Locked to provider |
| **Your data** | Stays on your machine — always | Sent to vendor |
| **API keys** | None required, none accepted | Required |
| **Cost** | Free after hardware setup | Ongoing subscription |
| **Offline** | Fully functional without internet | Requires connectivity |
| **Customizable** | Full source — fork and modify | Black box |

## The Lanes

Foxforge routes every request through one of three top-level lanes. Each lane is a pipeline of specialized agents running local models in sequence — not a single prompt, not a single model.

---

### Research Lane

Web and local evidence gathering, synthesis, and analysis. Powers the Fieldbook (web research) workflow.

**Tree planner** — a planner model (deepseek-r1:8b, `think=True`) decomposes the root question into a breadth/depth research tree. Leaves are assigned to the persona with the strongest affinity for that angle, so the four personas no longer fan out on identical questions.

**Four personas** execute leaves (2 concurrent by default):

| Agent | Role | Model |
|---|---|---|
| Market Analyst | Market dynamics, alternatives, competitive positioning | qwen3:8b |
| Technical Researcher | Feasibility, bottlenecks, implementation constraints | deepseek-r1:8b (`think=True`) |
| Risk Researcher | Failure modes, mitigations, systemic constraints | deepseek-r1:8b (`think=True`) |
| Execution Planner | Practical sequencing, milestones, resources needed | qwen3:8b |

Personas can **hand off** leaves to each other when a question sits outside their competence — loop prevention and a per-leaf handoff cap keep routing bounded.

Each agent applies **evidence discipline**: findings are labeled `[E]` (evidence-backed), `[I]` (inferred), or `[S]` (speculative). A self-check rates quality (1–5) before output. A gap assessment identifies what's missing. A final skeptic pass (deepseek-r1:8b) validates the full picture before synthesis.

**Synthesizer** — unifies all persona streams into a coherent narrative with cross-persona consistency validation.

**Citation linker** — post-processes synthesized text to anchor each sentence to the retrieved chunk that supports it; cosine-misaligned citations are dropped rather than passed through as fabrication.

**Skeptic sidecar** — the skeptic pass revises the publishable synthesis directly and writes its rationale to a separate `*.critique.md` sidecar file (linked in the artifact block when present).

**Web research cache** — repeat queries are served from a content-addressed SQLite cache with volatility-tiered TTL (24h general, 2h recency-sensitive, 10m live events).

**Web foraging stack** (optional, Docker): SearXNG + Crawl4AI for live web research.

**Stack-decision guard** — outside a `technical` topic, research requests that are purely stack-choice comparisons (for example SQLite vs Postgres, Flask vs FastAPI, Vue vs React) are short-circuited with guidance to re-run in a Technical topic.

---

### Make Lane

Artifact generation. The Make lane covers seven distinct pools, each a purpose-built multi-agent pipeline for a specific class of deliverable.

All pools run entirely locally. No request touches a remote API.

---

#### Essay Pool

Short-to-medium documents: essays, reports, briefs.

**Pipeline — 6 stages:**

```
Outliner → Writers (≤3 parallel) → Critic → Revisor → Compositor → Proofreader
```

| Stage | Agent | Model | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Outliner | qwen2.5:7b | Thesis and per-section structure |
| 2 | Writers | qwen3:8b | ~400-word sections, parallel |
| 3 | Critic | deepseek-r1:8b | Flags gaps, repetition, drift |
| 4 | Revisor | qwen3:8b | Applies critic notes to flagged sections only |
| 5 | Compositor | qwen2.5:7b | Title, transitions, conclusion |
| 6 | Proofreader | deepseek-r1:8b | Fact contradictions, truncation, tense drift |

**Topic-aware templates** adjust section structure automatically:

- `history` — Background → Key events → Historiographical debate
- `science` — Evidence review (RCT > observational > anecdotal) → Implications
- `finance` — Market context → Risk factors → Thesis & recommendation *(not financial advice)*
- `medical` — Clinical summary → Evidence tiers → Safety profile → Disclaimers *(not medical advice)*
- `animal_care` — Vet-reviewed evidence → Safety profile → Owner considerations
- `politics` — Policy context → Stakeholder analysis → Counter-arguments
- `sports` — Statistical analysis → Risk & uncertainty → Analysis & outlook
- `underground` — No restrictions; all agents route to unrestricted model
- `technical`, `math`, `parenting`, `general` — Domain-specific variants

**Output targets:** `essay` (full treatment), `brief` (skips critic/revision/proofreader), `blog`, `social_post`

Underground topics route every agent to `huihui_ai/qwen3-abliterated:8b-Q4_K_M`.

---

#### Longform Pool

Extended structured outputs: long-form essays, guides, tutorials, video scripts, newsletters, press releases.

**Pipeline — 6 stages:**

```
Planner → Writers (parallel) → Critic (think=True) → Revisor → Compositor → Quality Gate
```

**Type-specific targets with word count enforcement:**

| Type | Word Range | Structure |
|---|---|---|
| `essay_long` | 1,800–3,500 | Hook → Argument pillars (3–5) → Steelman counterpoint → Synthesis |
| `essay_short` | 400–900 | Hook → Argument → Counterpoint → Close |
| `guide` | 1,000–2,500 | Prerequisites → Steps → Verification → Next steps |
| `tutorial` | 1,200–3,000 | Goal → Setup → Core logic → Integration → Troubleshooting |
| `video_script` | 1,500–4,000 | Hook (0–15s) → Premise → Beats → Turn/Reveal → CTA |
| `newsletter` | 600–1,200 | This Week → Worth Your Time → One Idea → Dessert |
| `press_release` | 400–700 | Headline → Dateline → Lede → Body → Boilerplate → Contact |

Video scripts include `[SEGMENT: name]` and `[B-ROLL: description]` markers for production use.

Public-content guardrail: planner/compositor stages avoid personal specifics from profile hints (family, pets, health, workplace) unless the user explicitly asks for them.

**Models:** `qwen3:8b` (planner/writer/compositor), `deepseek-r1:8b` (critic, `think=True`). Upgrades to `qwen2.5:32b` + `deepseek-r1:14b` automatically when available.

---

#### Content Pool

Short-form, high-velocity content: blog posts, social posts, emails.

**Pipeline — 6 stages:**

```
Planner → Writers (≤3 parallel) → Critic (think=True) → Revisor → Compositor → Quality Gate
```

| Type | Word Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `blog` | 600–800 | Hook & headline → Context → Core (subheadings, examples) → CTA |
| `social_post` | 80–220 | Stop-scrolling hook → Body (2–3 lines) → CTA. Platform-aware voice. |
| `email` | 200–400 | Subject (<60 chars) → Front-loaded ask → Short body → Sign-off |

Drafter and Polish agents use `huihui_ai/qwen3-abliterated:8b-Q4_K_M` for creative latitude. Critic uses `deepseek-r1:8b`. Integrates learned feedback from the FeedbackLearningEngine across prior Make runs.

Public-content guardrail: planner/compositor stages avoid personal specifics from profile hints (family, pets, health, workplace) unless the user explicitly asks for them.

---

#### Specialist Pool

Domain-expert deliverables requiring specialized validation with enforced quality gates.

**Pipeline — 7 stages:**

```
Outliner → Writers → Domain Critic (think=True) → Revisor → Compositor → Quality Gate
```

**Supported domains:**

| Domain | Enforced Requirements |
|---|---|
| `medical` | Evidence tiers (RCT → observational → case study → opinion); safety profile; "not medical advice" |
| `finance` | Risk disclosures; assumption clarity; "not financial advice" |
| `sports` | Statistical claims with dates; injury/roster freshness notes |
| `history` | Source quality notes; historiographical balance; date/actor specificity |
| `game_design_doc` | Core loop clarity → Systems interlock → Scope feasibility → MVP vs. full vision |

Quality Gate enforces minimum 1,500 character outputs for medical/finance/history, required disclaimer presence, and truncation rejection.

---

#### Creative Pool

Long-form creative writing: novels, memoirs, books, screenplays.

**Pipeline — 5 stages:**

```
Story Planner → Scene Writers (sequential, continuity-aware) → Voice Critic → Revision → Compositor
```

Each scene writer receives the last 1,500 characters of the prior scene to maintain continuity. The Voice Critic checks tense, POV, pacing, and dialogue quality.

**Kind-specific formatting enforced:**

| Kind | Format Rules |
|---|---|
| `novel` | Scene headers, dialogue, interior monologue (italics), sensory anchoring, hooks |
| `memoir` | First-person intimate voice, time/place anchoring, reflective passages |
| `book` | Authority tone, thesis-driven, smooth evidence integration, reader address, subheadings |
| `screenplay` | INT./EXT. headings, action (present tense, ≤3 lines), character cues, sparse parentheticals, transitions (CUT TO / DISSOLVE TO) |

---

#### Web App Pool

Full-stack web applications: Flask backend + Vue 3 frontend + SQLite database, built on a fixed Canon v1 scaffold.

**Pipeline — 10 sequential stages:**

```
Spec Generator → Scaffold Copy → DB Architect (slot-fill) → API Implementer (slot-fill)
→ Vue Architect → Vue Implementer (slot-fill) → Integration Check → Integration Fixer (slot-fill)
→ CSS Writer (slot-fill) → README Writer (slot-fill)
```

| Stage | Output |
|---|---|
| Spec Generator | Emits validated `AppSpec` JSON (entities, routes, views) for deterministic slot-fills |
| Scaffold Copy | Copies `agents_make/canon/web_app_v1/` (working app shell before feature slots are filled) |
| DB Architect | Fills `schema.sql` slots (`tables`, `seeds`) from spec + life-admin seed |
| API Implementer | Fills `app.py` feature slots only (routes/imports) with envelope helpers + `py_compile` import-smoke checks |
| Vue Architect | Component/store plan derived from Flask routes |
| Vue Implementer | Fills `index.html` + `app.js` feature slots (Vue 3.5 prod CDN, Composition API, fetch-based, no axios) |
| Integration Check | Flags route/fetch mismatches, CORS issues, JSON field name divergence |
| Integration Fixer | Re-fills only the impacted slots (no full-file rewrites) |
| CSS Writer | Fills `styles.css` feature slot using Canon neuromorphic tokens (`var(--neu-*)`) |
| README Writer | Fills `README.md` feature slots (`feature-list`, `run-notes`) |

**Automated guardrails in-pipeline:** `py_compile` + import smoke + runtime smoke (`/api/health` + spec-derived GET probe), Vue binding audit (`setup()` return vs template refs), feature-coverage check (backend + frontend presence for user-named features), policy lints (route naming, envelope conformance, CSS token usage, strict comment/docstring checks), and plumbing integrity verification against Canon v1 outside slot regions.

**Extend Mode** — detects existing builds automatically.
- Canon build (`.canon-version` present): copies prior app and updates only named slots.
- Legacy pre-canon build: one-shot migration into Canon slots, then pins `.canon-version` for all future extends.

**Output structure:**
```
Projects/{slug}/implementation/{timestamp}_app/
├── schema.sql
├── db.py
├── app.py
├── templates/index.html
├── static/app.js
├── static/styles.css
├── README.md
├── BUILD_SUMMARY.md
└── INTEGRATION_NOTES.md   (if integration issues were found and fixed)
```

**Model:** `qwen2.5-coder:7b` (or `qwen2.5-coder:14b` when available, all generation stages)

---

#### Desktop App Pool

Desktop applications: .NET 8 + Avalonia UI, MVVM, Windows-first with Linux portability.

**Stack:** Avalonia 11.x UI framework + ReactiveUI ViewModels + SQLite data layer

**Pipeline — 7 sequential stages:**

```
Specifier → Architect → ViewModel Impl → View Impl → Services Impl → Build Check → README Writer
```

| Stage | Output |
|---|---|
| Specifier | App name, features, state model, data layer, UI layout, external dependencies |
| Architect | Full project scaffold: `.sln`, `.csproj`, `Program.cs`, `App.axaml` |
| ViewModel Impl | ReactiveUI ViewModels with `[Reactive]` properties and `ReactiveCommand`s |
| View Impl | AXAML Views (data-bound, no code-behind logic) + minimal code-behind files |
| Services Impl | `IService` interfaces + implementations (repositories, file I/O, etc.) |
| Build Check | Project structure validation, dotnet syntax check |
| README Writer | Windows build steps, Linux port notes, MVVM architecture overview |

**Output structure:**
```
Projects/{slug}/desktop_apps/{AppName}/
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── {AppName}.sln
└── src/{AppName}/
    ├── {AppName}.csproj
    ├── App.axaml / App.axaml.cs
    ├── Program.cs
    ├── ViewModels/
    ├── Views/
    ├── Models/
    └── Services/
```

**Models:** `qwen2.5-coder:14b` (architect/implementation stages), `qwen3:8b` (spec/readme)

---

### Talk Lane

Conversational orchestration. Requests that aren't research or build tasks route here — the Reynard layer handles multi-turn dialogue, memory retrieval, and personal context via `dolphin3:8b`.

**Fixed-stack capability injection.** Chat prompt assembly includes a static capabilities block for Make coding types:
- `tool` → Python 3.12+ single-file/CLI stack
- `web_app` → Flask 3.x + Vue 3.5 (CDN) + SQLite (`sqlite3`)
- `desktop_app` → .NET 8 LTS + Avalonia 11 + ReactiveUI

For these types, stack/framework/database choice is treated as system-fixed by default; re-evaluation is routed through a Technical topic.

**Two-stage routing gate.** Every incoming request is first scored by a semantic-router layer (embedding lookup against known web vs. no-web exemplars, ~20ms) and only falls through to the `gemma3:4b` intent confirmer for genuinely ambiguous messages. A second `qwen3:4b` context gate validates the routing decision against full conversation history before any web-research pipeline fires, eliminating false-positive crawls on long technical messages.

---

## Turn Orchestration (LangGraph)

Every turn runs through a LangGraph `StateGraph` defined in [SourceCode/orchestrator/pipelines/turn_graph.py](SourceCode/orchestrator/pipelines/turn_graph.py):

```
ingest → prompt_digest → intent_confirm → lane_route → context_gate
       → lane_execute → compose → persist
```

State is checkpointed at every node boundary into `Runtime/state/turn_checkpoints.sqlite` via `SqliteSaver`. Any past turn can be replayed end-to-end or resumed from a specific node via [turn_replay.py](SourceCode/orchestrator/pipelines/turn_replay.py); a regression harness ([regression.py](SourceCode/orchestrator/pipelines/regression.py)) re-runs a curated set of past turns against current code and flags semantic drift via embedding cosine comparison.

This replaces the legacy monolithic dispatch and makes turn failures debuggable: a crashed node leaves preceding checkpoints intact for inspection and resumable replay.

---

## Model Distribution

| Task | Model | Context |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestration / reasoning | deepseek-r1:8b | 12,288 |
| Research & synthesis | qwen3:8b | 12,288 |
| Conversation (Reynard) | dolphin3:8b | 8,192 |
| Creative writing | qwen3:8b | 12,288 |
| Content (unrestricted topics) | huihui_ai/qwen3-abliterated:8b-Q4_K_M | 8,192 |
| Specialist / longform | qwen2.5:32b / deepseek-r1:14b (if available) | 24,576 |
| Code (web apps) | qwen2.5-coder:7b / :14b | 12,288 |
| Desktop app scaffold | qwen2.5-coder:14b | 16,384 |
| Intent gate | gemma3:4b | 4,096 |
| Routing context gate | qwen3:4b | 4,096 |
| Embeddings / RAG / semantic routing | qwen3-embedding:4b | — |
| Make-type classifier (LT) | SetFit over sentence-transformers | CPU |

All models run locally via Ollama or llama.cpp. Model assignments are configurable in `SourceCode/configs/model_routing.json`.

---

## Inference Backends

Foxforge supports two local inference backends:

- **Ollama** — default backend; handles most models via the Ollama API
- **llama.cpp** (OpenAI-compatible endpoint) — for TurboQuant and custom quantized models; configured per-model in `model_routing.json` under `llama_cpp_servers`

The inference router automatically falls back to Ollama if a configured llama.cpp server is unreachable. Server backoff is 180s after failure.

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Foxforge exposes its research and memory surface as an MCP server — external tools (editors, assistants, other local agents) can call `forage`, `recall`, and `make_artifact` over stdio without touching the web GUI.

```bash
python -m orchestrator.mcp
```

Stdio is the default transport. HTTP is gated behind an explicit config flag and is localhost-only by default; enable with care if you're exposing over Tailscale.

Foxforge also consumes external MCP servers (filesystem, fetch) via [SourceCode/shared_tools/mcp_client.py](SourceCode/shared_tools/mcp_client.py) — configured in `SourceCode/configs/mcp_servers.json`.

## Local Image and Video Generation

Foxforge connects to [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) for image generation, enhancement, and image-to-video. This is optional and can run on a separate machine.

Supported configurations:

- Pony XL style presets (~8 GB VRAM)
- Classic SD presets (lower VRAM)
- Wan2.2 image-to-video (8+ GB VRAM, recommended 16+ GB)
- SVD XT fallback (4–6 GB VRAM)

For full setup details — required custom nodes, model files, workflow export, Wan2.2 activation, and fallback paths — see [ComfyUI image + video setup](docs/comfyui_image_video_setup.md).

---

## Security Notes

- Foxforge is local-only. No data is ever transmitted to an external AI provider.
- Startup scripts can bind to all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) for LAN/Tailscale access.
- Use loopback (`127.0.0.1`) to restrict to local access only.
- Configure host/port via `FOXFORGE_WEB_HOST` and `FOXFORGE_WEB_PORT`.
- Set `FOXFORGE_WEB_PASSWORD` when exposing beyond localhost.

## Configuration

Primary model and routing config:

- `SourceCode/configs/model_routing.json` — model assignments per lane, llama.cpp server entries, context sizes

Useful startup scripts:

- `start_foxforge_web.sh` (Linux, host/port flags)
- `start_foxforge_web.ps1` (Windows)

---

## Development Workflow

Provision a dev environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.lock
```

Run the standard check suite:

```bash
make check
```

Run checks individually:

```bash
python3 smoke_test.py
python3 run_integration_tests.py
python3 tools/ui_phase_smoke.py
python3 tools/repo_health_check.py
```

Optional feature installs:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-optional-docs.txt
pip install -r requirements-optional-bots.txt
```

## Packaging and Distribution

Create a clean distributable ZIP:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\create_clean_zip.ps1
```

GitHub-friendly ZIP (include docs/images, exclude installer EXE):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\create_clean_zip.ps1 -IncludeDocsAndImages -IncludeInstallerExe:$false
```

Build installer EXE:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build_installer_exe.ps1
```

## Troubleshooting

### Ollama not responding

Linux:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart ollama
sudo journalctl -u ollama -n 50
```

Windows:
```powershell
ollama serve
```

### Foxforge not starting

Linux:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u foxforge -n 50
```

Windows: re-run the start script and check terminal output.

### GPU not used by Ollama

AMD (Linux):
```bash
rocm-smi
groups $USER
# If render/video groups missing:
sudo usermod -aG render,video $USER
# Log out and back in
```

NVIDIA (Linux):
```bash
nvidia-smi
# If not found, reboot and check again
```

### Port conflict on web startup

Linux:
```bash
sudo systemctl edit foxforge
# Add: Environment="FOXFORGE_WEB_PORT=5051"
sudo systemctl restart foxforge
```

Windows:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\start_foxforge_web.ps1 -WebPort 5051
```
